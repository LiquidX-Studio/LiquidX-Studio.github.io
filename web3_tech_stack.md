# Choosing a tech stack for Web3 apps and services

![img](./img/buildingWeb3Foundations.png)

In the last few quarters, the liquidX studio's engineering team has built and shipped several web3 apps and services successfully.  

The web3 apps are built on a number of components and consequently requires one to choose between a variety of languages, platforms, services, and architecture components.  Our engineering team has tried  and tested a bunch of candidates before selecting the set that allows us to balance the tradeoffs between speed, quality, and other desired metrics.

# Target metrics
The architecture we choose and the tools and languages we choose usually is defined by the business goal we are trying to achieve.  The following list captures the metrics we choose to optimize, *your mileage may vary*.

## Quality
Although quality is on the top of the list of any software product, it is critical for web3 apps:
- First, the web3 apps' functionalities are often coupled with the value of the NFT or the currency a user holds.  As a result, a critical bug may have real-world negative financial impact for the users.
- Second, the value of the web3 organization is driven by its users' perceptions of the team.  A critical incident can potentially reduce the value of the organization in the eyes of those users.  That may have negative impact on its current revenue as well as future extensibility.

Considering the above observations, our aim was to choose tools and technologies that enables us to ensure high QoS for all of our products and services.

## Speed

## Extensibility

## Learning curve (ease of use)

## Data layer
We have chosen to use Postgresql to store the data for the apps and services.
